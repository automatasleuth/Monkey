AMAZING!!\n\nHow do we start?!! I also want everyone to know that Iâ€™m not sponsored, affiliated, or have anything to do with this company or Amazon. Iâ€™m leaving a review like this because of the excitement this system has brought me. I have used many different surround sound systems and this trumps every one I have used so far!!First off, the packaging is done very very well and all of your components are protected! There is so much packed in this box. There are wall mounts for all of your speakers, wires for everything, and very nice instructions. The subs are very impressive when you finally get down to the bottom of the box and you just start feeling like a child on Christmas morning!! Setup is very easy and detailed. I have 12â€™ vaulted ceilings so I did not set my speakers to upfire. I have the subs on both sides of the sofa, speakers behind the sofa, front surround speakers about 3â€™ in front of the sofa, and the soundbar mounted below the tv. Just so your aware, when you first turn this on and hear what it sounds like, do not be discouraged. Donâ€™t get me wrong, it will blow most people away without changing settings. But for the people with a more sensitive ear to quality, adjusting the treble, bass, center speaker volume, surround speaker volumes, room size, and stereo type, you will be very very pleased! The first thing I did was get a Dolby atmos video off of YouTube to try this thing out. Holy Moly!! The bass vibrated my entire house. My finance was getting ready in our bedroom which is about 50â€™ away from this system and said she could feel the house shaking! The surround speakers make you feel like your in the tv with the sounds circling you. Itâ€™s amazing! The soundbar and surround speakers are very crisp. Even at loud volumes! I canâ€™t tell you how loud it will go as itâ€™s already too loud at level 60 out of 100. Iâ€™ll either blow the windows out or get the police called on me if I go louder than thatðŸ˜‚. We just watched the new Planet Of The Apes with the kiddos and I asked them if the sound was as good as the theatre. They both said this system is better than the theatre because you can actually feel the rumbling and feel the sounds around you. I am so very pleased with this system!! There are some cons but nothing that would prevent me from giving this system 5 stars!! The cons I have run into so far is that the tv for some reason will not save and recognize the soundbar. So every time I turn the tv on, it asks me to name the HDMI. Iâ€™ve done this 20 times now and it still asks me. This may completely be that itâ€™s a cheap ONN tv and may not be anything to do with the soundbar. But it does not affect m me enough to look into it further. The other thing is that if you want to listen to music, I highly recommend downloading your music app to your tv and playing your music over WiFi. To most the Bluetooth may sound okay. But I find that the music is way more clear through my Apple Music app through the tv. The only thing I wish this system had is an app to control and setup the features and I wish the surround speakers were actually wireless. Other than that, this system is amazing! And please, whoever is reading this, please know that even the most expensive system on the planet will have its flaws. So please donâ€™t take my cons as me saying that you should not get this. They are just my personal opinions. I 100% recommend this system to anyone that can afford it! If you canâ€™t afford it, save for it because you need it ðŸ˜‚. Now Iâ€™m going to save up for the Nakamichi Dragon 11.4.6 Quad System!!\n\nRead more\n\nRussell Blackman\n\nMarchÂ 12\n\non\n\nAmazon\n\nThe sound bar works well with the tv remote for volume control.\n\nAwesome sound and great Bass response.
